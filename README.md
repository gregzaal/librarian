## Usage

- After [installing the add-on](http://blender.stackexchange.com/a/1689/9), you'll see a panel in the Scene settings.
- This panel automatically detects what files are being linked into this file and lists them. For each file, it shows how many of each kind of data-block there is.
- Click the little arrow on the left of each library to expand a full list of data-blocks.
